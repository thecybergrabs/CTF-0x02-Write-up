  ##### Solution:
  According to Description Wolf was using some application so let’s check it out visit `C:\users\wolf-pc\appdata\roaming` we can see `hexchat` is installed just analyze every file in the `hexchat` folder from `spam` file we got some long

string `maybethisthingwillbeusefull` ok in `likes` we can see that he likes `stargazer` lets search for `stargazer` we can find `stargazer.jpg` in `Pictures` now when you have some string and a `jpg` image just do `steghide` and we will get the flag.
