##### Solution:
According to description he‚Äôs hiding something on the internet so time to checkout web history.

`C:\Users\wolf-pc\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<profile folder>`

we can find it in the above path.
export `places.sqlite`

open it using `sqlite`

now just read the history and we can find there‚Äôs a `cryptobin.co` link `https://cryptobin.co/a1o8e8f7` and if you analyzed the text files he mentioned that he uses the same password everywhere so let‚Äôs use 4hacking (which we cracked in first challenge) and we will get base64 let‚Äôs convert it into a file we will get gif just use `exiftool` and we will get the flag.
