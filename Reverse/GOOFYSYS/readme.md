Its quite a simple binary, which has multiple hurdles in the form of characters, make sure to get that final magic hash which leads you to the flag.
Flag format: cybergrabs{}
Author: Elemental X
```

##### Solution:
Literally the same process as Reverseenc0. You donâ€™t need to care about any of the checks. Just find where the flag is printed, get the string that is moved onto the stack and convert to hex representation.

```
"string" --> "737472696e67" --> cybergrabs{737472696e67}
```

> *cybergrabs{737472696e67}*
